## All Beautiful Creatures

This is a book project that I have wanted to make for many years. My grandson is growing up and I will regret not having this ready for him while he is still a child.

The idea is that there are many ABC books for kids that have the usual suspects for animals, and I want to highlight all the animals that are never in those books. I also believe that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and so in my hunt for creatures I will look for many different thingsm things out of the ordinary.

There will also be a part to explain taxonomy - binomial nomenclature.

I am thinking the target audience is from 3-10, but since this is my first book, and a kids one at that, that there is much to learn.

I present to you: 

- Amazonian Royal fly catcher
- Onychorhynchus coronatus 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazonian_royal_flycatcher

I am about finished gathering animals, at least 2 per letter. Now will be reviewing them with friends, and deciding on the content. Next I will be picking a strategy for illustration and then looking for illustrators. Will also now be deciding and learning some typesetting software. 


Added an About page as well as an revisions page - to keep track of changes.
