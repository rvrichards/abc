ABC: All Beautiful Creatuers

Why This Book?

The books title will be "All Beautiful Creatures" (ABC). I will have an internet component that is a companion of the book - but that is well after I have written the book. I am starting to document it at my website. See http://rtfm.ca/js/abc  The creatures there are public domain ones, some are not the best images, but for now ok. I am 75% happy with my choices, but there are ones that I am not keen about and will change. That site will have changes every couple of days.

One animal - is probably an internet hoax (see Venezuelan Poodle Moth), but that is a good lesson in and of itself. Another does not exist - Yeti. Another is named after Sir David Attenborough. Others have weird names, others have weird skills: a frog with a biological gear - an actual gear.

Illustrations
Anyways, I want you to have a sense of what I am doing. I have thought about illustrations, and I am not settled on how it will end up being. My initial thoughs are this: I want 4 places for images.
- One spot for the same illustrator for A-Z - for consistency. I will pay for this
- Another spot for a child from families & friends to draw their interpretation.
- Another spot for an adult from families & friends to draw their interpretation.
- An empty spot for the owner of the book to draw.
This is my initial idea, but I am open to changing it if there is something better.

So what I am asking is for input if you'd like to be involved. I hope at least that all 4 of you would provide an "adult" or "child" drawn image. I do not know if you would want to illustrate all animals. I am not asking that for free, but I have no idea if you are interested. I have no idea of compensation, but am open to possibilities.  

I will also include attributions to all "adult" or "child" contributions in whatever form they would like. All The way from "child age 5" to a complete line like "Cranston Snord, male, 42 csnord@rtfm.ca open to offers." - haha

I think I have summed it up best I can. At this early stage I am really open to changes and new directions, but I am getting close to having animals picked and initial research. Feel free to ask me anything!

Thanks,
