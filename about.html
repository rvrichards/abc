        <h2>ABC: All Beautiful Creatures</h2>

        <a href="index.html">Main page</a>  

        <h3>Why This Book?</h3>
        <p>
            The books title will be "All Beautiful Creatures" (ABC). I saw a number of kids ABC books that had basically the same animals over and over, and figured I'd like to make one that has other animals worthy of mention and a book of their own. These animals could be beautiful to one person but ugly to another, and that means one of my goals has been met. A big part of this is to also introduce kids to some scientific principals and terminology used in the classification of animals. An another part is to make a book for my Grandson Elliot.
        </p>
        <h3>Self Publishing</h3>
        <p>
            I have done some research and feel confident with my IT back ground I will create and self publish the book. Software to use undecided at moment. I will create the manuscript and there are many print on demand resources on the interwebs for creating a physical copy. I might do a special print-run, that is print on folios and do some custom bindings.
        </p>

        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <p>
        I am collecting animals from A-Z. Some are quite great that I might have 2-3 animals for a single letter, that remains to be seen. I am using Wikipedia as my launching off point, trying to find many different animals that have different things about them that make them interesting or unique. We need to know the diversity of what we have on this planet. They sometimes do not have the best images, but it's my start.
        </p>    
        <p>
        At present I am 75% happy with my choices, but there are ones that I am not keen about and will change. One animal is probably an internet hoax (see Venezuelan Poodle Moth), but that is a good lesson in and of itself. Another does not exist: Yeti. Another is named after Sir David Attenborough. Others have weird names, others have weird skills: a frog with a biological gear - an actual gear.
        </p>    

        <h3>Going Forward</h3>
        <p>
        I am listing the animals at my website, that I will update every few days. If you are interested in collaborating in some way, feel free to contact me. I am also keeping a real paper book of my notes just because I love books. After the animals are picked it will be time to produce some content and get illustrations. I will solicit more family & friends input at this stage too.
        </p>    

        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>
        I plan on explaining taxonomy, the Latin naming convention of living creatures. The division of Kingdoms will be covered and a real world explanation of the difficulties of this process. It will be useful to know where we as animals fit in this chart.
        </p>    
        <p>
        Each living creature will be given some facts about them as well something that make them interesting. There may be a component of a story, but at this stage I do not know.
        </p>    
        <p>
        The target is for kids 5+, realizing that some content/reading/info might not be age appropriate, I will work this out more.
        </p>    
        <p>
        I am also seriously considering making a companion interactive-responsive (laptop to cell phonen) website, but that is down the road. 
        </p>    

        <h3>Illustrations</h3>
        <p>
        I am getting settled on how illustrations will be. I will not use photographs for this. My initial thoughts are this: I want 4 places for images.
            - One spot for the same illustrator for A-Z - for consistency. I will pay for this to some point.
            - Another spot for a child from families & friends to draw their interpretation.
            - Another spot for an adult from families & friends to draw their interpretation.
            - An empty spot for the owner of the book to draw.
        This is my initial idea, but I am open to changing it, nothing is printed yet!
    </p>    

        <h3>Contributions</h3>
        <p>
        There are a few parts to this. Here is what I think, people can help with more that one item.
            - Recommending a great animal to include!
            - Proofread and provide feedback in creating the content.
            - Provide an "adult" or "child" drawn image - will formally ask later on Facebook
                - Okay, by "adult" I mean someone over ... 16? 12-16 - they can decide where they fit.
                - If I need more I will expand to the interwebs
            - Anyone with book publishing knowledge is welcome to help.
        </p>    
        <p>
        The simplest is opening it up to have people draw the animal that they choose. I would gather the physical image of it, or a scan of it. I am not sure at this point as I need to research the best way to capture illustration for the book document that I will create. I would then have an attribution to the artist, both "adult" or "child" contributions in whatever form they would like. Attribution could be simple from "child age 5" to a complete line like "Cranston Snord, male, 42 csnord@rtfm.ca open to offers." - haha. The book would have these in the appendix.
        <p>
        As for compensation, I only foresee paying an illustrator, but since I am currently unemployed the budget may mean that I will have to find other possibilities. I cannot guarantee a share of profits will be worth it because at this point this is a 100% self published thing. I have zero interest if profiting off of this, or extensive marketing, and maybe I will donate to a worthy cause? This is my first go around at this.
        </p>    
        <h3>Wrap-up</h3>
        <p>
        This is a private effort, not funded by an international global capitalistic conglomeration. I have a couple of other books that I have started and embarrassed to stay, around 8 years ago! I will proceed with those depending upon how this goes.
        </p>
        <p>
        I love the idea of a book full of the names of people contributing - that I know and love.
